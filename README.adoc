== spiff

Spiff is a variant on Unix _diff_ that compares tokens, rather than lines. 
As the original author puts it, it makes "controlled approximate comparisons".
There are settings to ignore comments in common languages, ignore small floating point differences, etc.
It is thus great for:

* comparing minified JavaScript/CSS files;
* comparing two versions of a handed-in assingment;
* etc.

That's the good news. The bad news is that it was written in 1989, and may need some
cajoling to work on modern compilers and OSes. It has been somewhat patched for modern
BSD systems where it compiles with some warnings. Fixes for other systems may be incorporated.
